## Cross-Standard Coordination

A. Issues that affect multiple draft OGC API specifications should be checked against the [issues](https://github.com/orgs/opengeospatial/projects/4) at [OGC API - Common SWG](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-common) to confirm whether the topic has already been registered, and then let your [SWG representatives](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-common/wiki/Cross-SWG-Coordination-Representatives) know so that the issue can be flagged for discussion by the OGC API - Common SWG. If a new isue, please tag it with `Cross-SWG Discussion`. Resolution of the issue will be documented in a standard template as below:
 
      Specification:	name of the specification under discussion

      Objective:	describe the objective of the discussions.  Can be more than one
      •	<objective 1>
      •	<objective 2>
      •	<etc.>
      Discussion:	free text description of the discussions

      Outcome:	describe the conclusions.  Make sure you have clear concurrence on any actions.

      Risks/Mitigation:	discussions may not be entirely satisfactory.  What are the open risks and issues?  What do you propose to do about them?

      Comments:	Any additional information not covered by the categories above.

B. There is an OGC-wide proposed policy on “Naming of OGC API Standards, Repositories & Specification Elements" [OGC 20-059r4](https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=94196&version=1) that we SHALL try to follow.
