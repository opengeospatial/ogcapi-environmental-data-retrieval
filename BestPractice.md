This is a work in progress document to capture Best Practice for the implementation of the Environmental Data Retrieval API.

Some of the best practices may be applicable to spefici domains, such as meteorology or hydrology.

Currently the document is in markdown format, but will be converted to asciidoc with the formal OGC Best Practice template.
