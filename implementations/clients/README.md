# Using OGC API - EDR

This folder contains descriptions how GIS clients and libraries can be used to connect to APIs that implement OGC API - EDR. The focus is on examples and "how-to" descriptions that help others to use the software to connect to such APIs.

We welcome pull requests to update this page to add or update an entry for a client implementation that can be used to connect to APIs implementing OGC API - EDR. If it is your software product, please also update the [main page](../README.adoc).
