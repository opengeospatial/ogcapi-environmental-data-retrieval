# Implementations

#work-in-progress#

This page lists software packages that implement approved or draft OGC API Features standards. Draft standards are only added once they have a tagged version. Currently the following parts are covered:

* https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/19-086.html[OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval Standard 1.0]

Two types of software packages are distinguished:

* Server implementations are software products that can be used to set up APIs that implement OGC API - EDR conformance classes.
* Client implementations are software products that connect to APIs implementing OGC API - EDR conformance classes to use the feature data.


## Contribute

If you have a server or client implementation of OGC API - EDR, we welcome a pull request to update this page to add or update an entry for the product. You may add a link to a sub-page with more details in the link:servers[servers] and link:clients[clients] folders of this repository and you may add a link to the associated entry in the OGC Product Database. Please include a contact email address so that we may later contact you in case of page updates or questions.

If you have a server product, please consider to https://www.ogc.org/resource/products/registration[register it in the OGC Product Database] and https://cite.ogc.org/teamengine/[test it for compliance], too.

## Servers

The columns for each part list the conformance classes of the standard that are implemented by the server implementation. The conformance classes available in a specific API that is provided using the implementation will be listed in the https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/19-086.html#conformance-classes[Conformance Declaration resource] of the API.

## Clients

The columns for each part list the conformance classes of the standard that the client uses when connecting to an API and the API supports that conformance class.

### Clients supporting GeoJSON

Since most APIs implementing OGC API Features support the GeoJSON conformance class, any client that is able to process GeoJSON feature collections and features can also use feature data provide by OGC API - EDR items queries by directly accessing the Features resources (at the relative path `collections/{collectionId}/items`) as long as they can fetch all features in a single request without paging.

See the OGC API - Features link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/tree/master/implementations/clients[client implementations] for more information on GeoJSON-aware client libraries.

### Clients supporting CoverageJSON

Any client capable of supporting CoverageJSON is able to process EDR servers supporting the CoverageJSON conformance class.

See the link:clients/README.md[examples and descriptions for clients] for more information, for example, for link:clients/covjson-reader.md[covjson-reader] and link:clients/leaflet-coverage.md[leaflet-coverage].
