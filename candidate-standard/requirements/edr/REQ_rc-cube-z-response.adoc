^|A |If the `z` parameter is provided, only resources that have a vertical geometry that intersects the vertical information in the `z` parameter SHALL be part of the result set.
^|B |The `z` can be defined as a height range by specifying a min-level and max-level seperated by a forward slash "/" 
^|C |A list of `z` can be defined by specifying a comma delimited list of values level1, level2, level3 etc 
^|D |An Arithmetic sequence using Recurring height intervals can be specified by **R**`number of intervals`**/**`min height`**/**`height interval`
^|E |If the `z` parameter is not provided, the server SHOULD return data at all available vertical levels
