===== Parameter locationID

With the locations query a location is defined by a unique identifier, this is a string value.  It can be anything as long as it is unique for the required location, for instance a GeoHash `gbsvn` or a WMO station id like `03772`, what3words like `bolt.lime.metro` or place name like `Devon`.  The metadata returned by the API must supply a geospatial definition for the identifier.

Valid locationIDs must be discovered via another mechanism such as the <<rc_items-section,`items`>> query.
