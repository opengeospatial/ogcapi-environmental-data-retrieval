== Media Types

JSON media types that would typically be supported by a server that supports JSON are:

* `application/geo+json` for feature collections and features, and

* `application/json` for all other resources.

XML media types that would typically be supported by a server that supports XML are:

* `application/gml+xml;version=3.2` for any GML 3.2 feature collections and features,

* `application/gml+xml;version=3.2;profile=http://www.opengis.net/def/profile/ogc/2.0/gml-sf0` for GML 3.2 feature collections and features conforming to the GML Simple Feature Level 0 profile,

* `application/gml+xml;version=3.2;profile=http://www.opengis.net/def/profile/ogc/2.0/gml-sf2` for GML 3.2 feature collections and features conforming to the GML Simple Feature Level 2 profile, and

* `application/xml` for all other resources.

The typical HTML media type for all "web pages" in a server would be `text/html`.
