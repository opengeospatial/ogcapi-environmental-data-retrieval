^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/area*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that an error is returned by a `Area` query if no query parameters are specified.
^|Requirement |<<req_area,/req/queries/area>>
^|Test Method |. No query parameters are specified
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 400.

^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/area*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that an error is returned by a `Area` query when the coords query parameter is not specified.
^|Requirement |<<req_area,/req/queries/area>>
^|Test Method |. coords query parameter is not specified
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 400.

^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/area*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that an error is returned by a `Area` query when the coords query parameter does not contain a valid POLYGON Well Known Text value.
^|Requirement |<<rreq_position,/req/queries/position>>
^|Test Method |. Check coords query parameter is a valid Well Known Text Polygon value 
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 400.

^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/area*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that resources can be identified and extracted from a Collection with a `Area` query using  query parameters.
^|Requirement |<<req_area,/req/queries/area>>
^|Test Method |. Test with valid query parameters
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 200.

Repeat these tests using the following parameter tests:

*Coordinates*

* Parameter <<../../requirements/collections/edr/REQ_rc-coords-definition,/conf/collections/rc-coords-definition>>
* Response <<../../requirements/collections/edr/REQ_rc-coords-response,/conf/collections/rc-coords-response>>

*VerticalLevel*

* Parameter <<../../requirements/collections/edr/REQ_rc-z-definition,/conf/collections/rc-z-definition>>

*Parameters*
* Parameter <<../../requirements/collections/edr/REQ_rc-parameter-definition,/conf/collections/rc-parametername-definition>>
* Response <<../../requirements/collections/edr/REQ_rc-parameter-response,/conf/collections/rc-parametername-response>>

*DateTime*

* Parameter <<../../requirements/collections/edr/REQ_rc-time-definition,/conf/collections/rc-time-definition>>

Execute requests with combinations of the "coords","time","parametername","z","crs" and "outputformat" query parameters
and verify that only information that matches the selection criteria is returned.
