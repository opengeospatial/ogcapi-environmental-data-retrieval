== Requirements class "OpenAPI 3.0"

=== Basic requirements

APIs conforming to this requirements class document themselves by an link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#oasDocument[OpenAPI Document].

include::requirements/requirements_class_oas30.adoc[]

include::requirements/oas30/REQ_oas-definition-1.adoc[]

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/117[ISSUE 117] +

The OpenAPI media type has not been registered yet with IANA and will likely change. We need to update the media type after registration.

include::requirements/oas30/REQ_oas-definition-2.adoc[]

Two example OpenAPI documents are included in <<oas-examples,Annex B>>.

include::requirements/oas30/REQ_oas-impl.adoc[]

=== Complete definition

include::requirements/oas30/REQ_completeness.adoc[]

Note that APIs that, for example, are access-controlled (see <<security,Security>>), support web cache validation, CORS or that use HTTP redirection will make use of additional HTTP status codes beyond regular codes such as `200` for successful GET requests and `400`, `404` or `500` for error situations. See <<http-status-codes>>.

Clients have to be prepared to receive responses not documented in the OpenAPI definition. For example, additional errors may occur in the transport layer outside of the server.

* HTTP authentication,
* an API key (either as a header or as a query parameter),
