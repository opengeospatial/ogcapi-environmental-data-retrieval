  Defined it the user requires data at a different resolution from the native resolution of the data along the z-axis

  If this is a single value it denotes the number of intervals to retrieve data for along the z-axis
    
    i.e. resolution-z=10 
    
  would retrieve 10 values along the z-axis from the minimum z coordinate to maximum z  coordinate (i.e. a value at both the minimum z and maximum z coordinates and 8 values between).
