  Defined it the user requires data at a different resolution from the native resolution of the data along the x-axis

  If this is a single value it denotes the number of intervals to retrieve data for along the x-axis
    
    i.e. resolution-x=10 
    
  would retrieve 10 values along the x-axis from the minimum x coordinate to maximum x coordinate (i.e. a value at both the minimum x and maximum x coordinates and 8 values between).
