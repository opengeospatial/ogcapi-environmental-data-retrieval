    Define the vertical levels to return data from 
    
    The value will override any vertical values defined in the BBOX query parameter 
    
    A range to return data for all levels between and including 2 defined levels

    i.e. z=minimum value/maximum value

    for instance if all values between and including 10m and 100m

    z=10/100

    A list of height values can be specified
    i.e. z=value1,value2,value3

    for instance if values at 2m, 10m and 80m are required

    z=2,10,80

    An Arithmetic sequence using Recurring height intervals, the difference is the number of recurrences is defined at the start 
    and the amount to increment the height by is defined at the end

    i.e. z=Rn/min height/height interval

    so if the request was for 20 height levels 50m apart starting at 100m:

    z=R20/100/50

    When not specified data from all available heights SHOULD be returned
