  Defined it the user requires data at a different resolution from the native resolution of the data along the y-axis

  If this is a single value it denotes the number of intervals to retrieve data for along the y-axis
    
    i.e. resolution-y=10 
    
  would retrieve 10 values along the y-axis from the minimum y coordinate to maximum y coordinate (i.e. a value at both the minimum y and maximum y coordinates and 8 values between).
