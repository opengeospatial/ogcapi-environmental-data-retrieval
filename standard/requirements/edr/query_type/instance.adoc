Having multiple versions or instances of the same <<collection-definition,collection>>, where the same information is reprocessed or regenerated is not unusal.  Although these versions could be described as new <<collection-definition,collections>> the instance query type allows this data to be described as different views of the same <<collection-definition,collection>>.

===== *Parameter instanceId*

A unique identifier for the instance of the <<collection-definition,collection>> is specified as:

/collections/{collectionId}/instances/{instanceId}

.Return the Raw data instance metadata (instanceId = raw) for the Metar ((collectionId = metar) <<collection-definition,collection>>
=================

/collections/metar/instances/raw

=================

.Return the Level 1 Quality controlled data instance (instanceId = qc_lvl_1) metadata for the Metar (collectionId = metar) <<collection-definition,collection>>
=================

/collections/metar/instances/qc_lvl_1

=================



===== *Parameter queryType*

The queryType options are exactly the same as those available for <<collection-definition,collections>> that do not have multiple instances and support the same query parameters and functionality.  See <<query-resource-table>> for the  mappings of the query types. The queryType structure is:

/collections/{collectionId}/instances/{instanceId}/{queryType}

See <<query-resources-section>> for details of the query parameters supported by the queryTypes.


.A position query on a Raw data instance(instanceId = raw) for the Metar ((collectionId = metar) <<collection-definition,collection>>
=================

/collections/metar/instances/raw/position


=================


.A trajectory query on a Raw data instance(instanceId = raw) for the Metar ((collectionId = metar) <<collection-definition,collection>>
=================

/collections/metar/instances/raw/trajectory


=================
