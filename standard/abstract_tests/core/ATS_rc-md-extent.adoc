^|*Abstract Test {ats-id}* |*/conf/core/rc-extent*
^|Test Purpose |Validate the `extent` property if it is present
^|Requirement |<<req_core_rc-extent,/req/core/rc-extent>>
^|Test Method |

* Verify that the `extent` provides bounding boxes that include all spatial geometries
* Verify that if the `extent` provides time intervals that they include all temporal geometries in this collection.
* A temporal extent of `null` indicates an open time interval.
* Verify that if the `extent` provides vertical intervals that they include all vertical geometries in this collection.
* A vertical extent of `null` indicates an open vertical interval.
