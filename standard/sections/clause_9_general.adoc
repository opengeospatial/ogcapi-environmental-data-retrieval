[[general-section]]
== General Requirements

The following general requirements and recommendations apply to all OGC APIs.

=== HTTP 1.1

The standards used for <<webapi-definition,Web APIs>> are built on the HTTP protocol. Therefore, conformance with HTTP or a closely related protocol is required.

Apply <<req_core_http,Requirement /req/core/http>> for HTTP support.

[[http-status-codes]]
=== HTTP Status Codes

<<status-codes>> lists the main HTTP status codes that clients should be prepared to receive. This includes support for specific security schemes or URI redirection. In addition, other error situations may occur in the transport layer outside of the server.

|Status code |Description
|`200` |A successful request.
|`202` |A successful request, but the response is still being generated. The response will include a  `Retry-After` header field giving a recommendation in seconds for the client to retry.
|`204` |A successful request, but the resource has no data resulting from the request.  No additional content or message body is provided.
|`304` |An <<web-caching,entity tag>> was provided in the request and the resource has not been changed since the previous request.
|`308` |The server cannot process the data through a synchronous request.  The response includes a `Location` header field which contains the URI of the location the result will be available at once the query is complete <<asynchronous_queries,Asynchronous queries>>.
|`400` |The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error. For example, a query parameter had an incorrect value.
|`401` |The request requires user authentication. The response includes a `WWW-Authenticate` header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource.
|`403` |The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. While status code `401` indicates missing or bad authentication, status code `403` indicates that authentication is not the issue, but the client is not authorized to perform the requested operation on the resource.
|`404` |The requested resource does not exist on the server. For example, a path parameter had an incorrect value.
|`405` |The request method is not supported. For example, a POST request was submitted, but the resource only supports GET requests.
|`406` |Content negotiation failed. For example, the `Accept` header submitted in the request did not support any of the media types supported by the server for the requested resource.
|`413` |Request entity too large. For example, the query would involve returning more data than the server is capable of processing, the implementation should return a message explaining the query limits imposed by the server implementation.
|`500` |An internal error occurred in the server.

[[web-caching]]
=== Web Caching

Entity tags are a mechanism for web cache validation and for supporting conditional requests to reduce network traffic. Entity tags are specified by <<rfc2616,HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2616)>>.

include::../recommendations/core/REC_etag.adoc[]

[[cross-origin]]
=== Support for Cross-Origin Requests

If data is located on another host than the webpage ("same-origin policy"), access to data from a HTML page is by default prohibited for security reasons. A typical example is a web-application accessing feature data from multiple distributed datasets.

include::../recommendations/core/REC_cross-origin.adoc[]

Two common mechanisms to support cross-origin requests are:

* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)]
* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP[JSONP (JSON with padding)]

[[asynchronous_queries]]
=== Asynchronous queries

Responding to queries synchronously is not always be possible. The EDR API standard does not specify how to handle asynchronous requests. Different services may propose different best practices.

For example, if the query requires handling requests asynchronously, one option of many, is that the system could respond with a HTTP code  of `308` and include a `Location` response header field with the URI of the location of the data once the query has completed.  If the user queries the URI of the product of the query before the data is available that response should respond with a HTTP code of `202` and include a `Retry-after` response header field with a suggested interval in seconds to retry the data retrieval.

[[coordinate_reference_system]]
=== Coordinate Reference Systems

As discussed in Chapter 9 of the OGC/W3C Spatial Data on the Web <<SDWBP,Best Practices document>>, how to express and share the location of resources in a consistent way is one of the most fundamental aspects of publishing geospatial or spatio-temporal data and it is important to be clear about the coordinate reference system that the coordinates use.

For the reasons discussed in the Best Practices, EDR APIs SHOULD support WGS84 longitude and latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84) as a coordinate reference system.


[[rc_encoding-section]]
=== Encodings

While the OGC API - EDR standard does not specify any mandatory encoding, the following encodings are recommended. See <<optional_requirements_classes,Clause 2.2 (Optional Requirements Classes)>> for a discussion of this issue.

[[rc_html-section]]
HTML encoding recommendation:
include::../recommendations/core/REC_html.adoc[]

[[rc_geojson-section]]
GeoJSON encoding recommendation:
include::../recommendations/core/REC_geojson.adoc[]

[[rc_covjson-section]]
CoverageJSON encoding recommendation. This is specific to the EDR API:
include::../recommendations/core/REC_covjson.adoc[]

Requirement <<req_core_http,`/req/core/http`>> implies that the encoding of a response is determined using content negotiation as specified by the HTTP RFC.

The section <<media-types-section,Media Types>> includes guidance on media types for encodings that are specified in this document.

Note that any API that supports multiple encodings will have to support a mechanism to create encoding-specific URIs for resources to express links, such as for alternative representations of the same resource. This document does not mandate any approach to how this is supported by the API.

As clients simply need to dereference the URI of the link, the implementation details and the mechanism of how the encoding is included in the URI of the link are not important. Developers interested in the approach of a particular implementation, can study the API definition.

[NOTE]
=========================================================
Two common approaches are:

* An additional path for each encoding of each resource (this can be expressed, for example, using format specific suffixes like `.html`);
* An additional query parameter (for example, `accept` or `f`) that overrides the Accept header of the HTTP request.
=========================================================

=== Link Headers

include::../recommendations/core/REC_link-header.adoc[]

[[rc_oas30-section]]
=== OpenAPI 3.0

==== Basic requirements

Apply the <<rc_oas30,OpenAPI 3.0 Requirements Class>>.

The OpenAPI 3.0 Requirements Class used in OGC API - Common is applicable to the EDR API as well. So an implementation of EDR API which supports OpenAPI 3.0 as an API Description format shall also comply with the OpenAPI 3.0 Requirements Class (http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-common-1/1.0/req/oas30) specified in OGC API — Common.

Apply <<req_oas30_oas-definition-2,Requirement /req/oas30/oas-definition-2>> for OpenAPI 3.0 conformance.

Implementations shall also advertise conformance with this Requirements Class.

Apply <<req_oas30_oas-impl,Requirement /req/oas30/oas-impl>> for OpenAPI 3.0 implementation.

An example OpenAPI definition document is available at https://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/edr/1.1/openapi/ogcapi-environmental-data-retrieval-1.yaml

==== Complete definition

Apply <<req_oas30_completeness,Requirement /req/oas30/completeness>> for OpenAPI 3.0 Completeness.

Note, for example, that APIs which are access-controlled (see <<security,Security>>), support web cache validation, CORS, or that use HTTP redirection will make use of additional HTTP status codes as well as common codes such as `200` for successful GET requests and `400`, `404` or `500` for error situations. See <<http-status-codes>>.

Clients shall be prepared to receive responses not documented in the OpenAPI definition. For example, additional errors may occur in the transport layer outside of the server.

[[exceptions]]
==== Exceptions

Apply <<req_oas30_exceptions-codes,Requirement /req/oas30/exceptions-codes>> for OpenAPI 3.0 Exception codes.

[[security]]
=== Security considerations

The http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-edr-1/1.1[OGC API - EDR] Standard is an extension of <<OGC19-072,OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core>>. The <<OGC19-072,OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core>> Standard does not mandate any specific security controls. However, the Standard was constructed so that security controls can be added without impacting conformance.

Apply <<req_oas30_security,Requirement /req/oas30/security>> for OpenAPI 3.0 Security support.

The OpenAPI specification, which is used by the http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-edr-1/1.1[OGC API - EDR] Standard, currently supports the following link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#security-scheme-object[security schemes]:

* HTTP authentication,
* an API key (either as a header or as a query parameter),
* OAuth2's common flows (implicit, password, application and access code) as defined in RFC6749, and
* OpenID Connect Discovery.
