*ISO Declaration*

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.

== Abstract

The Environmental Data Retrieval (EDR) Application Programming Interface (API) provides a family of lightweight query interfaces to access spatio-temporal data resources by requesting data at a *Position*, within an *Area*, along a *Trajectory* or through a *Corridor*. A spatio-temporal data resource is a collection of spatio-temporal data that can be sampled using the EDR query pattern geometries. These patterns are described in the section describing the <<rc_core-section,Core Requirements Class>>.

The goals of the EDR API are to make it easier to access a wide range of data through a uniform, well-defined simple Web interface, and to achieve data reduction to just the data needed by the user or client while hiding much of the data storage complexity. A major use case for the EDR API is to retrieve small subsets from large collections of environmental data, such as weather forecasts, though many other types of data can be accessed. The important aspect is that the data can be unambiguously specified by spatio-temporal coordinates.

The EDR API query patterns, such as <<position-definition,Position>>, <<area-definition,Area>>, <<cube-definition,Cube>>, <<trajectory-definition,Trajectory>> or <<corridor-definition,Corridor>>, can be thought of as discrete sampling geometries, conceptually consistent with the feature of interest in the https://www.ogc.org/standards/sos[Sensor Observation Service (SOS)] standard. A typical EDR data resource is a multidimensional dataset that could be accessed via an implementation of the http://www.ogc.org/standards/wcs[Web Coverage Service (WCS)] standard. In contrast to SOS and WCS, the EDR API implements the technical baseline of the https://ogcapi.ogc.org/[OGC API] family of standards and aims to provide a single set of simple-to-use query patterns. Use cases for EDR range from real or virtual time-series observation retrievals, to sub-setting 4-dimensional data cubes along user-supplied sampling geometries. These query patterns do not attempt to satisfy the full scope of either SOS or WCS, but provide useful building blocks to allow the composition of APIs that satisfy a wide range of geospatial data use cases. By defining a small set of query patterns (and no requirement to implement all of them), the EDR API should help to simplify the design of systems (as they can be performance tuned for the supported queries) making it easier to build robust and scalable infrastructure.

With the OGC API family of standards, the OGC community has extended its suite of standards to include Resource Oriented Architectures and Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These standards are based on a shared foundation, specified in https://ogcapi.ogc.org/common[OGC API-Common], which defines the resources and access paths that are supported by all OGC APIs. The resources are listed in <<common-paths>>. This document extends that foundation to define the Environmental Data Retrieval API.

The resources identified in  <<common-paths>> primarily support Discovery operations. Discovery operations allow clients to interrogate the API to determine its capabilities and obtain information (metadata) about a distribution of a resource. This includes the API definition of the server(s) as well as metadata about the resources provided by those servers.

This standard extends the common query operations listed in <<common-paths>> by defining simple, coordinate-based, queries which are applicable to many spatio-temporal, including geospatial, resource types. Other OGC API standards may define additional query capabilities specific to their resource type. EDR Query operations allow resources or values to be retrieved from the underlying spatio-temporal resource data store. The information returned is based upon the selection criteria (query string) provided by the client.
