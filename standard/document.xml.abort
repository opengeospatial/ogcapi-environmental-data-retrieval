<script>Latn</script><abstract><p>The Environmental Data Retrieval (EDR) Application Programming Interface (API) provides a family of lightweight query interfaces to access spatio-temporal data resources by requesting data at a <strong>Position</strong>, within an <strong>Area</strong>, along a <strong>Trajectory</strong> or through a <strong>Corridor</strong>. A spatio-temporal data resource is a collection of spatio-temporal data that can be sampled using the EDR query pattern geometries. These patterns are described in the <xref target="rc_core-section">Requirement Class Core</xref> section.</p>
<p>The goals of the EDR API are to make it easier to access a wide range of data through a uniform, well-defined simple Web interface, and to achieve data reduction to just the data needed by the user or client while hiding much of the data storage complexity. A major use case for the EDR API is to retrieve small subsets from large collections of environmental data, such as weather forecasts, though many other types of data can be accessed. The important aspect is that the data can be unambiguously specified by spatio-temporal coordinates.</p>
<p>The EDR API query patterns, such as <xref target="position-defintion">Position</xref>, <xref target="area-definition">Area</xref>, <xref target="cube-definition">Cube</xref>, <xref target="trajectory-definition">Trajectory</xref> or <xref target="corridor-definition">Corridor</xref>, can be thought of as discrete sampling geometries, conceptually consistent with the feature of interest in the <link target="https://www.ogc.org/standards/sos">Sensor Observation Service (SOS)</link>. A typical EDR data resource is a multidimensional dataset that could be accessed via the <link target="http://www.ogc.org/standards/wcs">Web Coverage Service (WCS)</link>. In contrast to SOS and WCS, EDR implements the technical baseline of the <link target="https://ogcapi.ogc.org/">OGC API</link> family of standards and aims to provide a single set of simple-to-use query patterns. Use cases for EDR range from real or virtual time-series observation retrievals, to sub-setting 4-dimensional data cubes along user-supplied sampling geometries. These query patterns do not attempt to satisfy the full scope of either SOS or WCS, but provide useful building blocks to allow the composition of APIs that satisfy a wide range of geospatial data use cases. By defining a small set of query patterns (and no requirement to implement all of them), the EDR API should help to simplify the design of systems (as they can be performance tuned for the supported queries) making it easier to build robust and scalable infrastructure.</p>
<p>With the OGC API family of standards, the OGC community has extended its suite of standards to include Resource Oriented Architectures and Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These standards are based on a shared foundation, the OGC API-Common standard, which defines the resources and access paths that are supported by all OGC APIs. These are listed in <xref target="common-paths"/>. This document extends that foundation to define the Environmental Data Retrieval API.</p>

<p>The resources identified in  <xref target="common-paths"/> primarily support Discovery operations. Discovery operations allow clients to interrogate the API to determine its capabilities and obtain information (metadata) about a distribution of a resource. This includes the API definition of the server(s) as well as metadata about the resources provided by those servers.</p>
<p>This standard extends the <xref target="common-paths"/> common query operations by defining simple, coordinate-based, queries which are applicable to many spatio-temporal, including geospatial, resource types. Other OGC API standards may define additional query capabilities specific to their resource type. EDR Query operations allow resources or values to be retrieved from the underlying spatio-temporal resource data store. The information returned is based upon the selection criteria (query string) provided by the client.</p></abstract>

<li>
<p id="_dc3a176a-576d-4361-8439-29bfa208dad9">to make it easier to access a wide range of data through a uniform, well-defined simple Web interface;</p>

<p id="_b650815b-2031-4880-9ee1-be956c7ec536">The EDR API can be considered a ‘Sampling API’.

<p id="_42591d6d-2e22-409d-adaa-816f5688931c">The functionality provided by EDR query patterns could be realized through specific implementation of the SOS (and to some extent WCS) from the <link target="https://www.ogc.org/standards/common">OGC Web Services family of (XML-based) standards</link>. EDR introduces a streamlined JSON-based OGC API implementation of building blocks that could be used for many of the simple similar use cases addressed by SOS and WCS in the past.</p>

Rather, they define the behavior and content of a set of Resources exposed through a Web Application Programing Interface (Web API). Therefore, an API may expose resources in addition to those defined by the standard. A test engine must be able to traverse the API, identify and validate test points, and ignore resource paths which are not to be tested.</p></clause>

<title>Relationship between OGC API-EDR and OGC API-Features</title>
<p id="_a5f6edbb-0cb3-41ad-871d-ef691b53292c">The EDR API is completely compatible with OGC API-Features-Part 1 Core, in that it supports Collections and Items. It extends the Collection functionaliaty by allowing ‘Instances’, a form of ‘collection of collections’. The EDR API also supports the retrieval of spatiotemporal data by named location as well as coordinates.</p>

Moving features concerns things that move along a trajectory, and simultaneously change their orientation through rigid body rotation. The concepts are defined in UML and encoded in GML. EDR API does not have the concept of orientation, or foliation or prisms. EDR API is OpenAPI defined, over HTTP(S), and not defined in UML.</p>
<p id="_78636334-7e6d-40cc-965a-3e1a41a40e68">Moving Features and EDR API do share a common conceptual definition, from ISO, of a Trajectory, but Moving features encode in GML whereas EDR API encodes trajectories in WKT. Moving Features supports relationships between trajectories and other features, including other trajectories, EDR API does not. Moving Features also supports explictly concepts such as velocity, acceleration and distance along a trajectory. EDR API does not.</p>
<p id="_1b6aa5aa-4fc0-40ed-bddb-9e1d77b390b8">Moving Features considers trajectories as a primary resource to be queried, manipulated and processed, whereas in the EDR API, a trajectory is simply a query sampling pattern, encoded in WKT and ISO8601, into a spatiotemporal data resource.</p></clause>

Implementations of the EDR API are described using the OpenAPI V3.0 specification. The target users are web-developers and end-users who are not geospatial experts. The target data resources are any dataset described as spatiotemporal, accessible by coordinates.</p>
<p id="_4cbcb6be-9ae9-4fdf-a2a9-f31447c89d49">The EDR API is consistent with the WCS and CIS standards but do not require the end user or developer to use the terms Domain and RangeSet. The EDR API can also be used to generate a single query against a collection of coverages, providing the data coordinate reference systems are consistent. The EDR API can support any of the WCS and CIS output formats if required. At least one EDR API implmentation has been created by using a WCS/CIS implementation ‘under the covers’.</p>
<p id="_46b5f035-9d9a-48df-b95a-5aab225aecfc">The EDR API, with only a single form of spatiotemporal query, allows the retrieval of data from other data stores adhering to data models that are not coverages, such as features or observations.</p></clause>

<p id="_da90e7f9-6f6c-4b3b-987d-690ca7103b15">The primary messaging mechanism of the EDR API is JSON, including CoverageJSON, over HTTP(S). Implementations of the EDR API are described using the OpenAPI V3.0 specification. The target users are web-developers and end-users who are not geospatial experts. The target data resources are any data described as spatiotemporal, accessible by coordinates, not just meteorological or oceanographic.</p>
<p id="_f57d9d3d-9e42-43bf-b191-940e1e14bff0">In contrast, the Met Ocean Application Profile of Web Coverage Service 2.1 (WCS) is designed primarily to support XML-encoded messaging, in particular, for GetCapabilities and GetCoverage requests. Responses returning coverages are modelled according to the Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS), which can be XML, JSON or JSON-LD. Developers and end-users are expected to be familiar with the geospatial terminology of coverages, and use the Profile with predominately meteorological or oceanographic data.</p>
<p id="_fbfebf17-b48d-4e73-a0c7-a0edcf89f315">The EDR API and the Met Ocean WCS Profile therefore support different use cases. Developers that are interested in extending their OWS or WCS solutions to support the Met Ocean domain are advised to use WCS Met Ocean Application Profile. Developers that are implementing Web APIs that make use of the OpenAPI specification are advised to use the EDR API.</p></clause>
<clause id="_relationships_between_ogc_api_edr_sos_and_sensorthings_api" obligation="normative"><title>Relationships between OGC API-EDR, SOS and SensorThings API</title><p id="_5fce9da0-07f9-4059-9f3f-69c528696cbb">Both the Sensor Observation Service (SOS) and the SensorThings API enable access to observations made by sensors and transmitted over networks. As stated in Part 1 of SensorThings API “The main difference between the SensorThings API and the OGC SOS and Sensor Plannning Service (SPS) is that the SensorThings API is designed specifically for the resource-constrained IoT devices and the Web developer community” (OGC 15-078r6).</p>
<p id="_0e3b90f0-f529-4ace-93f4-14b3472aa87d">Therefore, although the SensorThings API had overlaps with SOS within Web use cases, the OGC Membership acknowledged that there were some use cases within the IoT that could not be efficiently or effectively addressed by the SOS. The same is true for the relationship between the EDR API and the SensorThings API.</p>
<p id="_e5600e7a-4051-4cb7-9f5a-6b719d425a4c">SensorThings API follows OData’s specification for requesting entities. That means the entity control information, resource path usages, query options, the relevant JSON encodings, and batch-processing request follow OData 4.0. In contrast, the EDR API makes use of the OpenAPI V3.0 specification for describing resource paths, query options, JSON schema, and other aspects.</p>
<p id="_a80436e6-626e-494e-979b-5a6a3402bf4a">Further, the EDR API allows for retrieval of coverage data and HTML responses – both of which are not supported by the SensorThings API. Therefore, developers that are interested in IoT devices and OData, and do not have a need for HTML previews of content are advised to make use of the SensorThings API instead. Similarly developers that are interested in XML-encoded observations and sensor model descriptions are advised to make use of the SOS.</p>
<p id="_6f0312fb-3ebd-4aab-af04-d4ce5111ce43">Similarly, an EDR or STA interface could be deployed on the same data set, so that users and developers that do not need the full details of observational, feature or coverage conceptual models and associated metadata could use the EDR API to hide the extra complexity, while users that do need all the details can use the STA API to retrieve those.</p></clause></annex><annex id="glossary" obligation="normative"><title>Glossary</title><dl id="ats-definition">
