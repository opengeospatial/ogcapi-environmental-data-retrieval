== OpenAPI requirements classes 

=== Requirements Class "OpenAPI Specification"

NOTE: This OpenAPI specification requirements class is abstract. Implementations can only conform to the concrete requirements classes <<rc_oas30,OpenAPI Specification 3.0>> or <<rc_oas31,OpenAPI Specification 3.1>>.

==== Basic requirements

Servers conforming to this requirements class provide an API definition as an OpenAPI Document. Note that this requirements class is not specific to a particular version of the OpenAPI specification. Requirements specific to a particular version are defined in separate, dependent requirements classes.

include::../requirements/requirements_class_oas.adoc[]

include::../requirements/oas/REQ_oas-definition.adoc[]

The requirements <<req_core_root-success,/req/core/root-success>> and <<req_core_api-definition-success,/req/core/api-definition-success>> in _Core_ require that the API definition documents are referenced from the landing page.

OpenAPI definitions can be created using different approaches. A typical example is the representation of the feature collections. One approach is to use a path parameter `collectionId,` i.e., the API definition has only a single path entry for all feature collections. Another approach is to explicitly define each feature collection in a separate path and without a path parameter, which enables specifying filter parameters or explicit feature schemas per feature collection. Both approaches are valid.

==== Complete definition

include::../requirements/oas/REQ_completeness.adoc[]

Note that servers that are access-controlled (see <<security,Security>>), support web cache validation, CORS or that use HTTP redirection will make use of additional HTTP status codes beyond regular codes such as `200` for successful GET requests and `400`, `404` or `500` for error situations. See <<http_status_codes>>.

Clients have to be prepared to receive responses not documented in the OpenAPI definition. For example, additional errors can occur in the transport layer outside of the server.

[[security]]
==== Security

include::../requirements/oas/REQ_security.adoc[]

The OpenAPI specification currently supports the following link:https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.4#security-scheme-object[security schemes]:

* HTTP authentication,

* an API key (either as a header or as a query parameter),

* OAuth2's common flows (implicit, password, application and access code) as defined in RFC6749, and

* OpenID Connect Discovery.


=== Requirements Class "OpenAPI Specification 3.0"

Servers conforming to OpenAPI Specification 3.0 requirements class provide their API definition as an link:https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.4#openapi-document[OpenAPI 3.0 Document].

=== Requirements Class "OpenAPI Specification 3.1"

Servers conforming to this requirements class provide their API definition as an link:https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.1#openapi-document[OpenAPI 3.1 Document].
