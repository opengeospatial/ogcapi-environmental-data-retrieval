*A:*

If the `datetime` parameter is provided, only resources that have a temporal geometry that intersects the temporal information in the `datetime` parameter SHALL be part of the result set.

---
*B:*

If a resource has multiple temporal properties, the API implementor decides whether only a single temporal property is used to determine the extent or all relevant temporal properties.

---
*C:*

The ``datetime`` parameter SHALL match all resources in the collection that are not associated with a temporal geometry.

---
*D:*

The temporal information is either a date-time or a time interval. The parameter value SHALL conform to the following syntax (using link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2234[ABNF]):


[source,java]
----
interval-closed     = date-time "/" date-time
interval-open-start = "../" date-time
interval-open-end   = date-time "/.."
repeating interval  = R[number of repetitions] / date-time / interval
datetime            = date-time
list of datetimes   = date-time, date-time, date-time
----
---
*E:*

The syntax of `date-time` is specified by link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6[RFC 3339, 5.6].
