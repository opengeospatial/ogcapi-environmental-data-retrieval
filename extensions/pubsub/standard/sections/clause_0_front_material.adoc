This document provides an overview of Publish-Subscribe patterns specific to event driven data workflows, as well as options for realizing Publish-Subscribe workflow in OGC APIs. The document builds on the OGC Publish-Subscribe White Paper (OGC document 20-081), as well as the Discussion paper for Publish-Subscribe workflow in OGC APIs (OGC document 23-013), and provides a baseline for Pub/Sub within the OGC API ecosystem.

*ISO Declaration*

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.

== Abstract

OGC APIs provide Web based capabilities which are typically based on polling for collection resource updates (new features/records items, coverages, maps, etc.). Depending on a collection’s temporal resolution or frequency of updates, an event-driven / Publish-Subscribe architecture provides a time, efficient and low latency approach for delivery of data updates. This paper provides recommendations on applying Publish-Subscribe architectural patterns to OGC APIs.

OGC APIs provide Web based capabilities which are typically based on polling for collection resource updates (new features/records items, coverages, maps, etc.). Depending on a collection’s temporal resolution or frequency of updates, an event-driven / Publish-Subscribe architecture provides a time, efficient and low latency approach for delivery of data updates. The following requirements and recommendations apply to Publish-Subscribe architectural patterns to OGC APIs.

== Security considerations

//If no security considerations have been made for this Standard, use the following text.

No security considerations have been made for this Standard.

////
If security considerations have been made for this Standard, follow the examples found in IANA or IETF documents. Please see the following example.
“VRRP is designed for a range of internetworking environments that may employ different security policies. The protocol includes several authentication methods ranging from no authentication, simple clear text passwords, and strong authentication using IP Authentication with MD5 HMAC. The details on each approach including possible attacks and recommended environments follows.
Independent of any authentication type VRRP includes a mechanism (setting TTL=255, checking on receipt) that protects against VRRP packets being injected from another remote network. This limits most vulnerabilities to local attacks.
NOTE: The security measures discussed in the following sections only provide various kinds of authentication. No confidentiality is provided at all. This should be explicitly described as outside the scope....”
