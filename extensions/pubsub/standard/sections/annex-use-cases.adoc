=== Earth System Prediction model run and data granules notification

A given numerical weather prediction system produces a weather forecast as part of a model run.  A model run typically has associated forecast hours.  Each forecast
hour makes available one to many weather elements at different pressure levels.

For example, Canada's Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS) produces two model runs per day, providing forecast of numerous weather elements for 33 pressure
levels, at a resolution of 15 kilometres.footnote:[https://eccc-msc.github.io/open-data/msc-data/nwp_gdps/readme_gdps_en].

A Pub/Sub workflow can be applied for an NWP system where:

- notifications are sent as individual weather elements (data granules) become available
- notifications are sent once the model run generation is complete, or "fully qualified"

As a result, Pub/Sub would eliminate the need for continuous polling while a model run is in progress.
