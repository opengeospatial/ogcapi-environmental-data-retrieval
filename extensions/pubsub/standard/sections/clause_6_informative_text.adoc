== Overview

Implementations of OGC API Standards provide Web based capabilities which are typically based on polling for collection resource updates (new features/records items, coverages, maps, etc.). Depending on a collection’s temporal resolution or frequency of updates, an event-driven / Publish-Subscribe architecture provides a timely, efficient and low latency approach for delivery of data resource updates.

The following requirements and recommendations apply to Publish-Subscribe architectural patterns for use with implementations of OGC API Standards.

The Publish-Subscribe architecture assumes reasonable connectivity or favorable DDIL conditions. https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/denied_disrupted_intermittent_and_limited_impact[DDIL] refers to Denied, Disrupted, Intermittent, or Limited communications.
