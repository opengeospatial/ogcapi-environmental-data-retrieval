== Terms and definitions

This document uses the terms defined in Sub-clause 5.3 of <<OGC06-121r9>>, which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word "`shall`" (not "`must`") is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard.

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.

=== Broker
