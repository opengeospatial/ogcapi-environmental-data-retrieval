== Scope

The OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval - Part 2: Publish-Subscribe Workflows Standard defines building blocks that can be assembled to implement Publish-Subscribe workflows (discovery, topic structure, encoding) as part of OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval - Part 1: Core. A topic structure is the structured information that a publisher makes available to allow subscribers to choose information of interest to them. 

This Standard defines a discovery capability that contains a topic structure in support of binding to notifications for data access and retrieval.

This Standard defines a baseline message payload which can contain summary descriptive information in GeoJSON about a given notification for new data events (new granule, new model run, etc.).
