== Conformance

Conformance to the OGC API-EDR-Part 3 Standard (this document) by a profile of the <<ogc-edr,OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval Standard>> can be tested by inspection. The test suite is provided in <<annex-A>>.

This Standard contains normative language and thus places requirements on conformance, or mechanism for adoption, of candidate standards to which this Standard applies. In particular:

* <<core-section,OGC API-EDR Requirements Class: Core>> specifies the core requirements which shall be met by all standards claiming conformance to this Standard.

Annex B provides guidance on how to build a profile of an ISO Standard. While not normative, following these practices increases the likelyhood that the suite of OGC API-EDR Standards and profiles will form an interoperable whole.
