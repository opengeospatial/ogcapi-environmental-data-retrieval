== Scope
[NOTE]
====
This Standard defines how to specify a Profile of the OGC API-EDR Part 1: Core Standard. It only defines restrictive profiles, not profiles that extend the EDR API Standard with new functionality. An extension may not maintain backward compatibility with the EDR API.

Some parts of this Standard could be used by other OGC API Standards and implementations.

The restrictions are defined in requirements. The requirements are defined by using JSON Schema fragments, which can then be formally tested.
