== Scope
[NOTE]
====
This Standard defines how to specify a Profile of the OGC API-EDR Part 1: Core Standard. It only defines restrictive profiles, not profiles that extend the EDR API Standard with new functionality, which may not maintain backward compatibility with the EDR API.

Some parts of the specification could be used by other OGC APIs.

The restrictions are defined by using JSON Schema fragments, which can be formally tested.
