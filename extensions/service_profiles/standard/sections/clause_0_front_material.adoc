*ISO Declaration*

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.

== Abstract

The OGC API-Environmental Data Retrieval Part 1: Core Standard was designed to be flexible and straightforward to understand and implement by Web developers. As the OGC API-EDR is being widely implemented, various groups of users have identified the need to restrict some of that flexibility. This is to improve interoperability between different implementations of both servers and clients within their domains of interest. An API-EDR Profile is a set of these stricter requirements for a specific user domain.

The goal of the OGC API-EDR Part 3: Service Profile Support Standard is to ensure interoperability between API-EDR implementations by defining a standard approach to specifying a Profile. 

To ensure such consistency, providers must adopt a standardized approach when defining `Collections` and their `Instances`. The OGC API-EDR Profile outlines a set of requirements that an EDR API implementation must meet to be considered compliant with the requirements specified in a service profile.

[NOTE]
====
The aim of the OGC API-EDR Part 3: Service Profile Support standard is to ensure interoperability between EDR API implementations by defining a standard approach to specifying a Profile of OGC API-EDR Part 1: Core. To achieve this, it is essential that service providers use a consistent approach when defining `Collections` and `Instances` of `Collections`. An OGC API-EDR Profile will specify a set of Requirements that an EDR API implementation must support to be a profile-Markcompliant implementation.

This standard specifies Requirements and Recommendations for a Profile definition, and also conforms to the OGC Mod Spec Standard.

It is envisaged that this approach may be useful for other OGC API Standards.

== Security considerations

//If no security considerations have been made for this Standard, use the following text.

No security considerations have been made for this Standard.

////
If security considerations have been made for this Standard, follow the examples found in IANA or IETF documents. Please see the following example.
“VRRP is designed for a range of internetworking environments that may employ different security policies. The protocol includes several authentication methods ranging from no authentication, simple clear text passwords, and strong authentication using IP Authentication with MD5 HMAC. The details on each approach including possible attacks and recommended environments follows.
Independent of any authentication type VRRP includes a mechanism (setting TTL=255, checking on receipt) that protects against VRRP packets being injected from another remote network. This limits most vulnerabilities to local attacks.
NOTE: The security measures discussed in the following sections only provide various kinds of authentication. No confidentiality is provided at all. This should be explicitly described as outside the scope....”
